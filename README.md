## Notes
The view screen in Xcode did not line up exactly like the iphone simulator, had to shift some items around to show all components in the simulator. 
I used this person's code as a template and modified it as needed: http://helpmecodeswift.com/app-examples/tip-calculator/tip-calculator-app.
One issue that still remains is that the Tap Gesture doesn't seem to work so the user can not get rid of the keyboard once activated.
